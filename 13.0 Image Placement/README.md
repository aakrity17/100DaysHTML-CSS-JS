### Day 13

In this tutorial, I learnt to use a property called `outline-offset` which allows you to give a outline while hovering. So, first the images were fetched from Unsplash and then applied the absolute positioning so that they lay on top of each other. `z-index` was provided at the beginning and then it was changed while hovering giving the pleasant effect.



**Here is the LIVE example of the stylsh offset effect**
